The source code was released under GPL but was only available through the author.
See http://sites.google.com/site/gatmkorn

With his passing, I am creating a repository of the source code so that code development might continue for
any interested programmer.

The initial commit is for the X86_64 linux version that was the center of development.

Compile all source files and link X11 library for program executable.
Refer to manual.pdf for the reference manual and http://sites.google.com/site/gatmkorn for further information.
