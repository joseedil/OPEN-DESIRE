# OPEN-DESIRE
Dr G. A. Korn's experiment-protocol interpreter and differential equation solver
The source code was released under GPL but was only available through the author.
See http://sites.google.com/site/gatmkorn

With his passing, I am creating a repository of the source code so that code development might continue for
any interested programmer.

Two versions of the code are provided. The older, portable version is arch independent and will run on a raspberry pi. The x86_64 version is processor specific and therefore more optimized and capable.

Compile all source files and link with -lX11 -lm for program executable.
Refer to manual.pdf for the reference manual and http://sites.google.com/site/gatmkorn for further information.

The last textbook was G.A. Korn, Advanced Dynamic-System Simulation: Model Replication and Monte Carlo Studies, 2nd Edition, Wiley, 2013
