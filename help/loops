	for i=n to m {step N}
 	    ... statements ...
 	    next                            | --  NOTE: not next i !!

	while a<b | ... statements ...
  	   end while

	repeat | ... statements ...
 	   until a+2*b>q*t

	Conditions may contain one "and" OR one "or" (as in "if"), e.g.

    	 while a<b and a<c*d            until a=b or a=c

	"exit" causes jump to end of current innermost loop.
	Loops can be nested but must not overlap.
	Automatic prettyprinting clarifies nesting levels.
