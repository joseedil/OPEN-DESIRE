                DESIRE INTEGRATION RULES (to 20,000 state variables)

irule 0      (default if program contains no d/dt) - simply executes
                the current DYNAMIC program segment NN times for graph
                plotting, fast compiled loops, recursion, difference
                equations, etc. 

irule 1      (default integration rule) - a fast fixed-step 2nd-order
                Runge-Kutta rule. DT is not programmable during a run.

irule 2      Euler rule, useful mainly for difference equations and
                for double-precision accumulation of statistics and
                other sums.  DT is programmable during a run.

irule 3      fixed-step 4th-order Runge-Kutta rule, programmable DT
irule 4      variable-step 4/2 Runge-Kutta rule
irule 5      2nd-order Runge-Kutta rule with programmable DT
irule 6      spare (not currently implemented)
irule 7      variable-step 2/1 Runge-Kutta rule (not very useful)
irule 8      variable-step 3/2 Runge-Kutta rule
