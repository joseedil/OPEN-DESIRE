                  DESIRE LIBRARY FUNCTIONS

Both interpreter programs and DYNAMIC segments admit the REAL functions

  abs(x)    round(x)   sqrt(x)   sin(x)    cos(x)    exp(x)   
  asin(x)   acos(x)    tan(x)    sinh(x)   cosh(x)   tanh(x) 
  sigmoid(x)  SIGMOID(x)         log(x) (base 10)    ln(x) (base e)

  atan(x)              atan2(y,x) = arctan(y/x)  between -PI and +PI

and also the piecewise-linear functions (see "help nonlin")

  lim(x)   sgn(x)   swtch(x)   sat(x)   deadz(x)   deadc(x)   rect(x)

where x is a REAL argument.  Refer to the manual for ran() and tim().


       Interpreter programs admit the additional functions of REAL x
 
  trnc(x) (truncation)         expj(x) = cos(x) + j*sin(x)

and the functions

  Re(z)   Im(z)   Cabs(z)   Arg(z)   Conjug(z)   exp(z)

of a COMPLEX argument z.
