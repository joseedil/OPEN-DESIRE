These examples demonstrate competitive learning with "conscience".
Competition for correlation (NQUANT) or for template matching using
CLEARN with crit=0 (NQUANTX, NQUANTY) is modified by a "conscience
vector" hh which, in the case of CLEARN, must be declared immediately
following the categorizer-layer vector y.  The conscience-vector
elements hh[i] measure the category counts and can be used to bias
the competition measure so as to prevent categories with excessive
counts from winning.

For NQUANTX and NQUANTY, replace crit=0 with crit=-1 to see what happens
when you remove the conscience mechanism.  It is also interesting to
see how the conscience affects the entropy of the CLEARN output.

"go to r" produces estimates of statistical relative frequencies and
entropy, as in VQUANT.PRC.  Increasing NN for both learning and recall
tends to make the statistical relative frquencies more nearly equal.
