TRICKS AND TREATS: RUNNING A SIMULATION IN THE BACKGROUND UNDER LINUX

It can be very useful to run a large statistical or optimization study, or
train a neural network, IN THE BACKGROUND while you use LINUX to do
something else (even if it is only a solitaire game).

To run long simulations or multi-run simulation studies in the background,
suppress runtime graphics with a display 0 statement (Manual Sec. 6-4), or
by omitting dispt, dispxy, and DISPXY display requests in your DYNAMIC
segments.

You can still watch the progress of your simulation in a suitably sized 
Command Window  by using write statements in the experiment protocol, or
type statements in a DYNAMIC program segment. The simulation program will
continue even while you work in other windows.

Once your Command Window shows that the simulation program is done, you can
edit the program to include graphics showing, say, the time history of the
last simulation run, or a crossplot and restart the new program.  You can
also run another program reading results of the earlier simulation from
.dat or .tim files.

We recommend that you omit dispt, dispxy, or DISPXY statements when you
want to run your simulation program in the background.
