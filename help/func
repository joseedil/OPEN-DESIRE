     The DYNAMIC-segment arbitrary-function generator called by

                        func y=F(x

produces a wide variety of functions y of the input x through
table-lookup and linear interpolation in a breakpoint-table array
F dimensioned and filled by the experiment-protocol program before 
drun is called.  

     A single function array can serve two or more  functions of
different variables:

                     func y=F1(x | func u=F1(p

      The array F must be filled with n/2 breakpoint abscissas F[1]
through F[n/2], followed by n/2 breakpoint ordinates        
F[n/2+1] through F[n] for a desired function (Fig. 4-2, DESIRE
text).  Beyond the range of the table, the output is y=F[n/2+1] for
x<=F[1], and y=F[n] for x>=F[n/2].


NOTE: A better (and equivalent) way is to declare the function-table 
array F with

	ARRAY X[n/2]+Y[n/2]=F

where X is an array of n/2 breakpoint absacissas, and Y is an array of n/2 
breakpoint ordinates.

     A program can compute entries for such function tables (DESIRE
text), or one can use data/read assignments to fill a function array
from a data list.
