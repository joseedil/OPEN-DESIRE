CPMAP.src simulates a counterpropagation function-mapping network.

The network accepts one-dimensional pseudorandom input x1 and matches its
utput y to a target function f(x1).  Typing "go to eee" produces an editing
screen which allows you to change the number of categories, optimization
parameters, and display scale. You can also substitute any target function you
like. You can edit the programs to obtain different error displays.
